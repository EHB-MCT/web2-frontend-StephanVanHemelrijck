***Note: You will need an account to use my site. You can use a fake email and any type of password, even 1 character ones.***

However if you don't want to create one yourself. Feel free to use the one below.

## What is the idea?

The name of the site should give it away, if not though.. My idea behind creating this website is that anyone, at any time, at any place, can create a cycling route. As a casual cyclist myself, there are times where I get lost - Especially when I am abroad. So I decided to create something that will help guiding me wherever I go. Sounds interesting right?

## Some important features

### Account
- Signing up / Logging in
- Deleting your account ( and all your created routes )
- Remember me ( will keep you logged in for 1 week )

### Routes
- Creating a route
- Saving a route
- Browsing routes
- Favoriting routes
- Finding routes by city

## To add in the future
- [ ] Create an update password possibility
- [ ] Add a route details page
- [ ] Display route distance
